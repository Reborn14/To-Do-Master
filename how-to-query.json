The response may contain fewer than page_size of results. If the response includes a next_cursor value, refer to the pagination reference for details about how to use a cursor to iterate through the list.\n\n📘\n\nWiki databases can contain both pages and databases as children.\n\nFilters are similar to the filters provided in the Notion UI where the set of filters and filter groups chained by \"And\" in the UI is equivalent to having each filter in the array of the compound \"and\" filter. Similar a set of filters chained by \"Or\" in the UI would be represented as filters in the array of the \"or\" compound filter.\nFilters operate on database properties and can be combined. If no filter is provided, all the pages in the database will be returned with pagination.\n\nThe above filters in the UI can be represented as the following filter object\n\nFilter Object\n{\n  \"and\": [\n    {\n      \"property\": \"Done\",\n      \"checkbox\": {\n        \"equals\": true\n      }\n    }, \n    {\n      \"or\": [\n        {\n          \"property\": \"Tags\",\n          \"contains\": \"A\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"property\": \"Tags\",\n          \"contains\": \"B\"\n        }\n      ]\n  \t}\n  ]\n}\n\n\nIn addition to chained filters, databases can be queried with single filters.\n\nJSON\n{\n    \"property\": \"Done\",\n    \"checkbox\": {\n        \"equals\": true\n   }\n }\n\n\nSorts are similar to the sorts provided in the Notion UI. Sorts operate on database properties or page timestamps and can be combined. The order of the sorts in the request matter, with earlier sorts taking precedence over later ones.\n\nThe properties of the database schema returned in the response body can be filtered with the filter_properties query parameter.\n\nhttps://api.notion.com/v1/databases/[database_id]/query?filter_properties=[property_id_1]\n\n\nMultiple filter properties can be provided by chaining the filter_properties query param.\n\nhttps://api.notion.com/v1/databases/[database_id]/query?filter_properties=[property_id_1]&filter_properties=[property_id_2]\n\n\nProperty IDs can be determined with the Retrieve a database endpoint.\n\nIf you are using the Notion JavaScript SDK, the filter_properties endpoint expects an array of property ID strings.\n\nJavaScript\nnotion.databases.query({\n\tdatabase_id: id,\n\tfilter_properties: [\"propertyID1\", \"propertyID2\"]\n})\n\n📘\n\nPermissions\n\nBefore an integration can query a database, the database must be shared with the integration. Attempting to query a database that has not been shared will return an HTTP response with a 404 status code.\n\nTo share a database with an integration, click the ••• menu at the top right of a database page, scroll to Add connections, and use the search bar to find and select the integration from the dropdown list.\n\n📘\n\nIntegration capabilities\n\nThis endpoint requires an integration to have read content capabilities. Attempting to call this API without read content capabilities will return an HTTP response with a 403 status code. For more information on integration capabilities, see the capabilities guide.\n\n📘\n\nTo display the page titles of related pages rather than just the ID:\n\nAdd a rollup property to the database which uses a formula to get the related page's title. This works well if you have access to updating the database's schema.\n\nOtherwise, retrieve the individual related pages using each page ID.\n\n🚧\n\nFormula Limitation\n\nIf a formula depends on a page property that is a relation, and that relation has more than 25 references, only 25 will be evaluated as part of the formula.\n\nErrors\n\nReturns a 404 HTTP response if the database doesn't exist, or if the integration doesn't have access to the database.\n\nReturns a 400 or a 429 HTTP response if the request exceeds the request limits.\n\nNote: Each Public API endpoint can return several possible error codes. See the Error codes section of the Status codes documentation for more information."

    "html": "Sort database entries\n\nA sort is a condition used to order the entries returned from a database query.\n\nA database query can be sorted by a property and/or timestamp and in a given direction. For example, a library database can be sorted by the \"Name of a book\" (i.e. property) and in ascending (i.e. direction).\n\nHere is an example of a sort on a database property.\n\nSorting by \"Name\" property in ascending direction\n{\n    \"sorts\": [\n        {\n            \"property\": \"Name\",\n            \"direction\": \"ascending\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n\nIf you’re using the Notion SDK for JavaScript, you can apply this sorting property to your query like so:\n\nJavaScript\nconst { Client } = require('@notionhq/client');\n\nconst notion = new Client({ auth: process.env.NOTION_API_KEY });\n// replace with your own database ID\nconst databaseId = 'd9824bdc-8445-4327-be8b-5b47500af6ce';\n\nconst sortedRows = async () => {\n\tconst response = await notion.databases.query({\n\t  database_id: databaseId,\n\t  sorts: [\n\t    {\n\t      property: \"Name\",\n\t      direction: \"ascending\"\n\t\t  }\n\t  ],\n\t});\n  return response;\n}\n\n\nDatabase queries can also be sorted by two or more properties, which is formally called a nested sort. The sort object listed first in the nested sort list takes precedence.\n\nHere is an example of a nested sort.\n\nJSON\n{\n    \"sorts\": [\n                {\n            \"property\": \"Food group\",\n            \"direction\": \"descending\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"property\": \"Name\",\n            \"direction\": \"ascending\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n\nIn this example, the database query will first be sorted by \"Food group\" and the set with the same food group is then sorted by \"Name\".\n\nSort object\nProperty value sort\n\nThis sort orders the database query by a particular property.\n\nThe sort object must contain the following properties:\n\nProperty\tType\tDescription\tExample value\nproperty\tstring\tThe name of the property to sort against.\t\"Ingredients\"\ndirection\tstring (enum)\tThe direction to sort. Possible values include \"ascending\" and \"descending\".\t\"descending\"\nEntry timestamp sort\n\nThis sort orders the database query by the timestamp associated with a database entry.\n\nThe sort object must contain the following properties:\n\nProperty\tType\tDescription\tExample value\ntimestamp\tstring (enum)\tThe name of the timestamp to sort against. Possible values include \"created_time\" and \"last_edited_time\".\t\"last_edited_time\"\ndirection\tstring (enum)\tThe direction to sort. Possible values include \"ascending\" and \"descending\".\t\"descending\""
